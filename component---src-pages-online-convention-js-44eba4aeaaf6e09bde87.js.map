 <h3>Main resolution of the National Convention on “Ongoing peasant movement” held on May 15,2021.</h3>\r\n    \r\n    <br />\r\n    \r\n    <p>This online  National convention, at the call of All India Kisan Khet Mazdoor Sangathan, AIKKMS, expresses its wholehearted revolutionary greetings to the struggling farmers across the country, particularly the farmers of the states of Punjab, Haryana, UP, Rajasthan etc. sitting on the Delhi borders, facing all kinds of repression-harassment, heat-and-cold, various kinds of conspiracies, malicious propaganda, crisis due to Lockdown,  fighting with undaunted spirit to advance this movement since last 6 months to repeal  the three black farm laws and the electricity bill -2020 and to ensure the legal guarantee for government procurement of farmers’ produce at one and a half times the cost price.This convention holds this opinion that three farm acts and electricity bill-2020 is detrimental to the interest of the peasantry, as well as of the common people of our country and will serve the interest of the corporates of home and abroad.So this convention demands to repeal these acts and bill immediately.This convention also demands the legal guarantee for the government procurement of the agricultural produce at one and half times of its production cost.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Whole country is now in a very precarious condition due to second wave of covid pandemic.This convention demands to the central and state governments to make adequate arrangement to make the lives of our people safe.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>This convention notes that Government of India is sitting with its eyes and ears shut towards this largest and completely peaceful peasant movement .This is a matter of great regret.This convention strongly condemn this anti-people attitude of the BJP led central government.This convention  expresses its gratitude to the students, youths, women, trade unions, intellectuals, lawyers, doctors, medical  organisations who have been providing  support to the kisan andolan since the very beginning.</p>\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n    <p><b>This convention urge upon the people of India to come forward and stand by the peasant movement to defeat the heinous design of the BJP government to serve their corporate masters.We shall fight, we will win.</b></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  </>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default
