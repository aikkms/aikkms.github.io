Long back in 1950, comrade Shibdas Ghosh,one of the foremost Marxist thinkers of the era, founded our organisation, AIKKMS.From then on,guided by his teachings,we have organised hundreds of movements to safeguard the interests of the toiling millions of our country. In those movements, hundreds of our workers and leaders embraced death as friend and showed us how to fight heroically. As a result of those struggles, AIKKMS now has become  one of the foremost organisations in our country, working in 25 states  having one million  primary members.

We are witnessing it in our daily life.Debt burdened Peasants are committing suicide. Peasants are loosing their land and are increasing the numbers of the rural proletariat. Agricultural workers are not getting work. Sufferings  of their lives know no bounds. Comrade Shibdas Ghosh taught us that it is nothing but the concomitant result of the exploitative capitalist system. So long capitalist state system exists, this exploitation and oppression will  exist. So to put an end to this exploitation and oppression,we are to crush this capitalist state system and establish a new Socialist one,free from all sorts of exploitation and oppression.
