Long back in 1950, comrade Shibdas Ghosh,one of the foremost Marxist thinkers of the era, founded our organisation, AIKKMS.From then on,guided by his teachings,we have organised hundreds of movements to safeguard the interests of the toiling millions of our country. In those movements, hundreds of our workers and leaders embraced death as friend and showed us how to fight heroically. As a result of those struggles, AIKKMS now has become  one of the foremost organisations in our country, working in 25 states  having one million  primary members. Toiling people of our country have witnessed how AIKKMS played a commendable role in  recent Delhi peasant movement,where peasants fought heroically with undaunted spirit and forced the fascist Modi government to repeal the three black farm acts.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But we know,in spite of its defeat , the attack of the multinationals will continue . The crisis ridden capitalism will try its utmost to shift it's burden on the shoulders of the common peasants and agricultural workers. We are witnessing it in our daily life.Debt burdened Peasants are committing suicide. Peasants are loosing their land and are increasing the numbers of the rural proletariat. Agricultural workers are not getting work. Sufferings  of their lives know no bounds. Comrade Shibdas Ghosh taught us that it is nothing but the concomitant result of the exploitative capitalist system. So long capitalist state system exists, this exploitation and oppression will  exist. So to put an end to this exploitation and oppression,we are to crush this capitalist state system and establish a new Socialist one,free from all sorts of exploitation and oppression. This is the task bestowed on us by history.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But in order to perform this historic responsibility,we are to close our ranks and build up our organisation in such a way that we can fulfill our behest. That is what we are trying to do at present. We have built up thousands of village committees,and near about five hundred block committees in hundred sixty two districts  of twenty one states. We have started our work in another four states. In short, our organisational strength is growing rapidly.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>But we think, this is not enough.We are to travel many a miles to reach our goal. We are to carry the revolutionary ideology to the peasants to build up their uncompromising struggle against the rule of capital on the basis of the teachings of Comrade Shibdas Ghosh. We are to build up thousands and thousands of class conscious struggle committees at the grassroot level,we are to build up class conscious volunteer corps across the country,we are to mobilize the different sections of the toiling people as the friends of the peasant movement and act as most revolutionary ally of the Indian revolution under the leadership of the proletariat . 3rd All India conference of AIKKMS is a step forward to this end. <b>We are sure that \"we shall fight, we will win\".</b></p>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Long live peasant struggle!
