        <h4>Resist all attacks of imperialism-Capitalism</h4>

        <p>It is an hour of pride. A new chapter of history has been written. Braving all odds, overcoming all obstacles, enduring scorching heat, heavy rains and biting cold, disdaining the red eyes of the government-administration and a sacrificing over 700 precious lives of their co-fighters, the struggling peasants have snatched their desired victory and forced the BJP government as well as its mentors, the monopolists and multinationals, to bow down and accept almost all their demands.  This is a landmark, not only in the history of democratic movement of this country but of the entire world. This victorious movement of Indian peasants would inspire the toiling masses to build up struggle against injustice and oppression in the days to come.</p>

        <p>The BJP government thought that they would easily get away with enactment of the Black Farm Laws. Because there was no force to resist. Almost all forces and political parties were in favour of these laws. The Congress, Trinamool Congress, Akali Dal and even pseudo-Marxists like the CPI (M), CPI who are found opposing the BJP in election, had long surrendered to the interest of the ruling monopolists and multinationals. On the eve of elections, they would give some fiery speeches, issue some belligerent statements but would not go for an effective resistance. Rather they would , overtly or covertly, work to ensure that the Black Laws get safe passage. Besides, there is pliant media who would release a persistent campaign to justify these Laws, to prove that the Laws were not against the peasants rathe in their favour.  Above all, there is Supreme Court. If it sensed danger, it would stand by the government and the multinational and give ruling in favour of the Laws and help the government to implement the same.</p>

        <p>Moreover, there is Covid-19-induced lockdown. Let alone conducting movement, people are not in a position to go out of home. Taking advantage of the same, the Railways, Banks and Insurance companies have been handed over to the corporates without any resistance. Similarly, agriculture would also be corporatized without any hassle. Forest, water, farmland, cultivation, agricultural produce—everything could be gifted to the private monopolists and multinationals. As a result, these corporate sharks would reap fabulous profit whereas the peasants would pauperized and distressed. They could hardly imagine that the peasants would be awakened to launch a fearless death-defying movement and frustrate all the planning. But exactly that has happened. Lakhs of peasants rose up with cemented unity and raise slogans: “Repeal the Black Farm Laws”. “We shall Fight, we shall win.”</p>

        <p>This is only but natural. The autocratic rulers do not get a measure of people&#39;s power. They consider the oppressed people as hapless and pity-seekers, presume  that they have no strength;they are weak, unfit. They could be purchased by money or made to bend under threat. Pressed by the problems of life, the masses often come out to the streets and raise voice. But such voice can be muffled in no time with the help of the coercive machinery. So far, this has only happened. So the rulers thought that there was nothing to fear about outburst of accumulated grievance or developing movement against the Black Farm Laws.</p>

        <p>But those who build up movement as conducive to bring about desired social change along the right scientific way, they know that in every age, it is people who have created history. Toiling people only have tamed fire, discovered agriculture, animal husbandry, boats for sailing in the rivers, wheels to make transport faster. These common people have been the creators of history and builders of civilization. Common people have immense power. They create their own leadership, own organization as per requirement. Outwardly, howsoever ignorant they might appear, it is not so. Great Marxist leaders starting Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin- Mao Zedong to Shibdas Ghosh,  have repeatedly advised the vanguards of revolutionary movement to go to the masses and learn from the masses. They never considered the common people as helpless but possessor of immense strength. They themselveshave learnt from the masses and that is why, they could become great leaders and teachers of the people. They have taught that no matter how deadly is the weaponry of the oppressing rulers, if the masses are united and organized based on correct ideology, they can destroy the exploitative system and create a new society. They do possess that capability. Repeatedly, such has happened in history. So they have taught to keep confidence in people. The historic victory of this epoch-making peasant movement has once again attested the invaluable teachings of these giant communist leaders.</p>

        <h4>Wherefrom the peasants got this immense strength</h4>

        <p>The history of struggle of the peasants and rural people of India is glorious.  The Santhal rebellion, the revolt of the Neel peasants and such other upheavals of the peasants and rural poor surged forth during the initial period of British rule. Thereafter, the peasants of undivided Punjab built up mighty movement against the British imperialists. The powerful &#39;Pagri SaamalHo&#39; (Hold your turban)  movement of 1906  of the peasants against the British imperialist rulers and their Indian associates was a legendary one. Ajit Singh, uncle of great revolutionary Bhagat Singh, led that movement. During the fag end of the British regie, the peasants of Bengal spearheaded the historic &#39;Tebhaga movement&#39; (Three equal apportionments of the crops). “we shall give our life but not rice, not our self-respect”—such slogans had rented the air of rural Bengal. The land of Bengal was soaked in blood because of the brutality of the British rulers to crush that movement. Innumerable fighting peasants embraced martyrdom. In these movements, AIKKMS played an important role. Similar movements were developed by the peasants in various other provinces as well. They were not hesitant to lay down their lives for upholding their cause. Through these movements, the peasants significantly contributed towards social progress. Even after independence, the peasants have risen up against the oppression and repression of the ruling Indian monopolists and their servitor governments, both at the centre and in the provinces.</p>

        <p>In early 1990s, after sad dismantling of socialism in Soviet Russia and eventual collapse of the mighty socialist camp, world imperialism-capitalism, undeterred in a unipolar world, introduced ruinous prescripts of globalization-liberalization-privatization. Attack of the multinationals descended upon the peasants. Resistant movements burst forth in various parts of the country. A new chapter in the history of gallant peasant struggle was written by the peasantry of Singur and Nandigram in West Bengal. Boldly they stood against the pro-monopolist policy of the CPI (M)-led government and declared that they would not allow handing over arable land to the Tata or Salem group. The CPI (M) government arrayed its entire coercive machinery to break those movements. Unbearable atrocities were let loose on the mothers and sisters. But nothing could diffuse the indomitable spirit and valour of the peasants. Continuing the death-defying movement, they compelled the CPI (M) government and the multinationals to retreat. In the period of globalization, this was the first victory of the peasants against the multinationals and their pliant government. The peasants created an epoch-making history. Emboldened by the experience of these struggles, the peasants of this country have been developing many legitimate movements to protect their right, life and livelihood. The anti-Mittal movement in Odisha, anti-SEZ movement of Maharashtra, movement against forcible grabbing of land in UP and Haryana are some such of the movements which merit mention. Somewhere the peasants were victorious. In some places, they had to face defeat. But the struggles have been going on relentlessly. Flame of agitation and revolt began to be aglow in the hearts of the peasants. From experience, they have understood that united movement alone can thwart the deadly attack of the monopolists and multinationals desperate to establish their firm hold on Indian agriculture.  When they found that the ruling BJP government had framed three Black Farm Laws with a view to handing over the entire agricultural sector to the multinationals and corporate giants, both domestic and foreign, they could no more remain mum. From their past experience, they could make out that if these three laws were implemented, they would lose their land, both fertile andforest, as well as their means of livelihood. So they closed their rank and plunged into a resistance movement against these three Black farm Laws. Their fists were clinched in one resolve—<b>We shall force the government to repeal these anti-peasant laws. We shall force them to bend.</b></p>

        <p>Let us see what were prescribed in the three Black Farm Laws.</p>

        <h4>Brief features of the three Black farm Laws </h4>

        <p>What were contained in the three Black Farm Laws the peasants were determined to annul through sustained death-defying movement?  To state in brief, the first law was purported to handover all necessary items including food articles like rice, wheat, pulses, lentils, edible oil, vegetables, fish, meat etc. to the multinationals and agri-giants so that they could buy them as much of quantity as possible, store them and then release them as per their wish to sell at astronomical prices to reap maximum profit. For this, The Essential Commodities Act 1955 was thoroughly  revised that to let them snatch even our morsel. But the provision of  prevailing &#39;Minimum Retail Price&#39; for procurement of agricultural produce  was coming in the way. At present, there are around 7,500 markets under the &#39;Agricultural Produce Market Committee&#39; (APMC) Act. In these market, 30-32% of  crops are procured by government agencies at MSP. And that to some extent has an impact on retail price. If such markets continue to exist and the agricultural produce are sold there at MSP, it would create a hindrance before total corporatization of  essential items. This had been a thorn in the neck of the monopoly houses and multinationals. So, they needed to destroy these APMC markets. In the second Black Farm Law, this very need of the corporates was sought to be served. So, it was proposed that there would be private markets besides these government-approved APMC markets or mandis and, the corporates would also be allowed entry to APMC market areas. In other words, arrangements were afoot to create private mandis  alongside APMC mandis. We all know what has been the consequence of allowing private schools to mushroom beside government schools. The government schools have been in the red whereas school education has been virtually in the captivity of the private houses. Same was to happen here. Because of deliberate neglect of the government, the APMC markets would close down one after another and the private mandis would replace them. The entire procurement system of agricultural produce would be in the hands of the giant monopolists and multinationals and the peasants would be forced to sell their crops to them at whatever price they fix. We are well aware of the gameplan the Ambanis-Adanis and other monopolists. They would purchase crops at throw away prices from the peasants and sell them to common people at hefty prices. Last year, the Adani group purchased apples from the peasants in Himachal Pradesh at Rs 18 per kg and sold those in retail market at Rs 269 Rs per kg. This would have been the fate of all agricultural produce had the Black Farm Laws been in force. So the peasants would have been in utter distress and the common people  in acute hardship. That would have been the fallout.</p>

        <p>Is it a far-fetched though of ours that the government mandis would have been gradually abolished? Not at all. Already 47 out of 247 mandis in Madhya Pradesh have perished. Similar is the case in Karnataka. So, it is proved beyond doubt that our apprehension was not unfounded. Another important aspect should be remembered in this connection. If the government-controlled mandis cease to exist, the government would not have any food article at its disposal. Then whatever little of rapidly diminishing public distribution system is in vogue would also no more be there. In that event, all of us would have to be at the mercy of the profit-hungry corporate sharks for a piece of roti or a handful of rice. We would have to purchase all essential food items from the market at the price determined by the corporates. Needless to say, that price would be astronomical. That would signal death knell of not only the peasants but the common toiling masses at large. Hunger and starvation deaths would soar. We are thus being pushed to the precipice of such a ruinous future.</p>

        <p>The third Black Farm Law was about legalizing contract-farming. Who would be the partners of such contract farming. On the one side would be the giant multinationals, their servitor government, the ruling party and the utterly corrupt administration while on the other side, would be the helpless peasants owning two to four acres of land or even less than that. So, it is clearly a contract between two highly inequal parties. The proposed Law stipulated that the price would be fixed s per the quality of the crop. But who would verify the quality? Obviously the agri-giant multinationals. The peasants would hardly have any say. What would have been the guarantee that the multinationals would not brand an &#39;A&#39; grade crop as “C&#39; grade and pay lower price? Is it not known to us that these multinationals and corporate houses are highly dishonest and are only for reaping maximum profit through maximum exploitation? What would have the peasants done then other than returning home with paltry price for their produce and then shed tears? If the corporates refuse to buy crops on the pretext of low quality, the peasants would have nothing to do. Even if the produce are bought, there is no guarantee that the corporates  would pay price in time. Multinationals would pay at their whims; might not pay at all. These are no cock-and-bull stories concocted by us. This is the truth. I UP, the peasants have contract with the owners of the sugar mills. The peasants there supply them sugarcanes. Thereafter, the peasants have to perspire as if dying to realize the price. Sometimes, it takes 4 to 5 years to get the price. Instances are not in short supply where the price is not paid at all. As per available data, payment of around Rs 12000 crore is pending. The peasants doubt whether this money would be received at all. The flower-producing peasants of Karnataka also have the same experience. Would all these demons turn into saints if the Black Farm Laws of the BJP Prime Minister Modi were operationalized and timely settle the payments to the peasants? Can it be imagined? The corporate capital has another problem. In order to have a roaring trade with agricultural produce, they need to grow crop variety as per their choice. They need to go for producing those crops which are in demand at national as well as international markets and thereby fetch them enormous profit. They would like to have those crops in time meaning so long the markets would remain stimulated for them. For that, they could not depend on the wishes of the peasants. They would be o the look out or those peasants who would be able to supply the stipulated crop as per the necessity of  the corporates. That is why is needed contract farming. There is no precedence in the world that the peasants have gained through contract farming. The multinationals have immensely gained whereas the peasants faced catastrophe. This is the reality.</p>

        <h4>Peasants are aware that PM Modi&#39;s assurance cannot be relied upon</h4>

        <p>In order to assuage the feelings of the aggrieved peasants, Modiji had said that there was nothing to fear about as these laws were framed to serve their interest. These laws would benefit the peasants. Their income would be doubled. But the peasants did not rely upon such hollow promises. Because they knew such assurances were of no value. Earlier Modiji and his government had given a lot of promises. They said they would unearth black money and credit everyone&#39;s bank account with Rs 15 lakhs, provide 2 crore jobs every year, bring down the prices and usher in &#39;achhe din&#39;(good days). But not a single promise has been kept. In their regime, there is spurt in black money, mounting rise in unemployment, crores of people have lost jobs in just one year, prices have spiralled sky-high and fuel tariff has been hiked phenomenally. Subsidy on kerosene has been abolished. In a word, their rule has brought immense misery to the life of the workers and peasants. On the other hand, the profit of the monopolists have soared astronomically. So, from experience the peasants have realized that words of Modiji and his government are not to be believed. They are servitors of the monopoly capital and enemy of the toiling people. So when they found that all these Black Farm laws were framed to hand over the entire agricultural sector to the monopoly capital and hence were inimical to their interest, they were not swayed by Modiji&#39;s tall assurances.</p>

        <h4>Experience of the peasants in the privatization spree</h4>

        <p>Peasants have experienced what a calamity has been brought to them during the privatization spree. Ours is a capitalist country. People here are being pressed under the grinding wheel of ruthless capitalist oppression day in and day out. The privatization spree after 1990 has further accentuated their hardship and pauperization. The peasants had seen that the erstwhile Congress government had handed over the entire agricultural input trade i.e. manufacture and distribution of seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides to the private monopoly houses. Even price of diesel used for running shallow pumps had increased manifold. as a result, price of all these agricultural inputs as well as electricity had risen steeply. So cost of agricultural production had gone entailing necessity of more funds. Situation has further worsened during the BJP rule. Where would the peasants get funds from? Banks seldom give them loan. Access to other institutional  credit also eludes them. So they are forced to borrow from local moneylenders at an interest as high as 8 to 10% per month. On the other hand, there is no way the peasants could get remunerative price of their produce. Being unable to repay the loans, the peasants often commit suicide. In every 12 minutes, one peasant commits suicide in our country. Peasants have seen how, dure to these policiesof liberalization-privatization have forcibly grabbed their land and gifted to the multinationals. The Singur-Nandigram movement was a historic struggle against these disastrous pro-monopolist policies. The then CPI(M) of West Bengal attempted to forcibly seize their land and give to the monopolist Tata and Salem groups. The peasants shed their blood to thwart the attempt. Likewise, in Odisha, the peasants had build up a massive resistance to prevent the Mittal group to acquire their land in connivance with the state government. And in Mumbai, they to wage struggle against establishment of the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) by the Ambanis. Thus, many peasants; movements have been conducted against the monopoly takeover of agriculture since 1990. So peasants have been aware of the heinous schemes of the monopolists and multinationals. They have been knowing how the governments come forward to protect the interest of the corporate houses. So the conscious awareness about the sinister machinations of the monopoly houses and their caretaker governments germinating in them over time had crystallized into an invincible power and indomitable spirit to give rise to this historic movement. This movement has disdained all kinds of odds and obstacles and overcome them. The participating peasants are ready for any sacrifice clinch all out victory. So it is necessary to keep the background given above in mind while having correct grasp of this movement.</p>

        <h4>What are the long-standing demands of the peasants</h4>

        <p>Some of the demands have long been raised from the platforms of peasants’ movements in our country. These demands have been as follows: i) distribution of all agricultural inputs to the peasants by the government at a cheaper  price and prevention of entry of monopoly houses and multinationals in this sector, ii) government should procure the agriculture produce from the peasants directly at remunerative price, (iii) distribution of agricultural produce to common people at an affordable price by the government, iv) No private trade would be allowed in production and distribution, both wholesale and retail, of essential items and food articles. This is what we call all-out state trading. This can alone save the peasants and the toiling Indians.</p>

        <p>The very demand of legalizing MSP is a part of this demand for all-out state trading. There is no law at present in regard to MSP. It is entirely upto the government to announce NSP and decide whether it would buy crops at MSP or not.So has arisen the demand for legalization of MSP. The movement has demanded an MSP at least 1 ½ times of total cost of agriculture taking into account all factors. Then only the peasants can eke out a livelihood. But the government is having a dilly-dally over this question. Though they are half-willing to consider this under pressure movement, it is very doubtful whether they would ultimately accede to this demand. They are arguing that  the government does not have enough fund to procure the entire crop production at MSP. But our counter-argument is where is the dearth of funds? When the big corporate sector is given huge tax concessions and exemptions, when bank loans of several lakh crores of rupees are waived, the government does never raise the question of paucity of funds. From 1990 to 2019, around Rs 45 lakh crores of tax concessions have been granted to the corporate sector, leave apart condoning hefty bank loans and other exemptions. The government can be extraordinarily benevolent with the corporates. But all their difficulties arise when it comes to the question of saving the peasants and distribute food items to the countrymen at cheaper rate.</p>

        <p>What is the responsibility of the government? Their responsibility is to provide food and shelter to the people, ensure proper education and healthcare to them and ensure their all-out development. Are the governments discharging this responsibility? No, not at all. They are not looking after the basic necessities of the myriads of suffering people. Instead they are busy in ensuring that the handful of monopolists amass mind-boggling wealth. so 73% of the country’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of 15 super-rich Indians. And the peasant are forced to commit suicide. Over 4.5 lakh peasants have committed suicide in last 15 years. When being unable to bear with the growing and pestering problems of life, the hapless peasants are adopting the path of movement, the government has been jumping on them with batons, bullets and tear gas. What is the use of having such a government? What shall we do with such a government? So the people have rightly chosen to take to the path of struggle against such a government.</p>

        <h4>The peasants have foiled all sinister moves and malicious propaganda of the BJP government to crush the movement</h4>

        <p>The BJP government tried to crush this movement in various ways. At the outset, they tried to put barricade to prevent the peasants from entering the capital. Then they resorted to baton-charge, used water cannons, fired tear gas shells and even bullets to frustrate the Delhi march of the peasants. But the bending spirit of the peasants frustrated all their attempts. Thereafter the ruling quartets launched a malicious campaign trail to denigrate the struggling peasants. They sought to malign the peasants as Khalistanis, terrorists and agents of Pakistan.  But when that also failed, they tried to precipitate divide among the struggling peasants. many peasants’ organizations and innumerable peasants participated in the movement. They had different ideologies, opinions and outlook. The calculation of the BJP government was that by fomenting those differences and using a few of their subservient organizations, they would be able to drive a wedge into the fighting unity of the peasants and destroy the movement with ease. But the peasants once again foiled their evil design. Despite difference of opinions, the fighting zeal of the peasants inspired the various peasants’ organizations to remain firmly united. The peasants could make it clear to the various participating organizations that until the government repealed the three Black Farm Laws, legalized MSP, ensured government procurement of the crops at MSP and withdrew the proposed Electricity (amendment ) Bill 2021, the movement would continue. There ought not to be any understanding with the government on any other condition. So, the effort to create cleavage among the peasants’ organizations proved abortive.</p>

        <p>Another trickery of the BJP government was to kill time. For that reason, they prolonged the negotiation,  went on fixing one after another meeting date, wasted time on the negotiation table by invoking one after another irrelevant issues but never showed any genuine interest to resolve the matter. They thought this delaying tactics would pay. The peasants would be unable to continue the movement in biting cold, get frustrated and return home. When this tactics also failed, they brought out of the bag their ultimate weapon i.e. the Supreme Court. when seven rounds of discussion ended inconclusively, the government side in the 8th round asked the peasants to go to Supreme Court and held that they would accept the verdict of the Apex Court. But the reply of the peasants was very clear. They said they were not fighting any legal battle but are on the street to save their life and livelihood. They were feeling no need to knock at the judiciary.  The government had framed the anti-peasant black laws. So, it was incumbent on the government to revoke those laws. All said and done, the Supreme Court was approached by the government and the ruling that came was surprising. The Court stayed implementation of the laws and constituted a committee to look into the pros and cons of the laws. What a ‘great’ committee was formed! It comprised members who all were supporters of the Black Laws. They were on record to have written articles in the media endorsing the Black Laws enacted of the BJP government. In any case, the peasants clearly stated that they were not intending to have a stay from the Court. They wanted to repeal the Laws, lack, stock and barrel. So long the Laws are not abrogated, they would continue their movement. Nor would they go to the committee formed by the Supreme Court. They did not even an iota of doubt that the Laws are outright anti-peasant and distinctly pro-corporate. So, there was no question of having any opinion of the committee. So, the cunning move of the government to break the movement by using Supreme Court also proved futile. In fact the verdict of the Supreme Court went in favour of the BJP government and the corporate houses. The objective of the corporates and the BJP government was to the send the peasants back home by somehow cajoling them. If they could do so, there would no more be any obstacle before implementing the Black Laws. The thorn on their side would cease to exist. Their expectation was that the Supreme Court ruling would come handy to them. The peasants made no mistake in detecting the alliance of the BJP government, corporate houses and the Supreme Court. So they did not think of relenting in any way and decided to carry on the struggle. Then the BJP government adopted the most reprehensible measure. The peasants proposed a massive tractor rally on 26 January 2021. The government planted their agents in that rally who by design indulged in some provocative adventurism which the BJP government and administration highlighted to show the peasants’ movement in bad light. When that too also failed, they directly let loose RSS stormtroopers on the peasants. But they peasants courageously repelled that attack. Thus the peasants frustrated all heinous attempts of the BJP government to destroy the movement.</p>

        <h4>Glorious role of AIKKMS</h4>

        <p>In begetting cherished success of this historic movement, the AIKKMS, based on Comrade Shibdas Ghosh Thought, has played a glorious role. And in course of discharging that role, our leaders and cadres had to often face police atrocities and court arrest. Boldly facing such attacks, AIKKMS leaders and activists had discharged this commendable role history adjured them. The BJP government issued the ordinance to introduce these three Black Farm Laws on 5 September 2020. From that very day, the AIKKMS started campaign against these laws with a view to developing a powerful movement. In thousands of villages spanning over 21 districts, the AIKKMS undertook task of making the peasants aware of the ruinous consequences of these Laws. They moved to as many villages as possible, organized group sittings, street corner meetings, mass meetings, dharnas (squalling), road blockades, recruitment of volunteers, distribution of lakhs of leaflets and online seminars to explain to the peasants the dangerous fallout of the three laws and rouse them in protest. Alongside was taken up the task to set up innumerable village committees as weapons of the movement. The  response was tremendous. People including the peasants could realize the dangerous features of the Black Laws. Thereafter, when the peasants started their march to Delhi by breaking the barricades, AIKKMS activists from Haryana joined them and played a commendable role. When squatting began at various borders of Delhi, AIKKMS workers from different parts of the country prominently participated in those sustained sit-in demonstrations. At every border gatherings, AIKKMS workers undertook campaigning among the peasants. They had also informed them how the peasants across the country have risen up in support of the movement.</p>

        <p>At the initiative of AIKKMS, volunteers from the medical fraternity organized running camps to provide healthcare support to the fighting peasant. On average, 600 patents were treated per day in these camps. The friends of the Medical Service Centre had played a prise-worthy role in this regard.</p>

        <p>It is not that  there were no vacillations at times within the movement. Particularly, when the BJP government proposed that they would postpone implementation of the Laws by one year and a half and let the peasants return home happily, some of the participating organizations thought that at least something positive had been achieved and so the movement could be called off. At this crucial juncture, AIKKMS played a significant role. In the meeting of the Sanjukta Kishan Manch, we said: “The peasants are sitting at the borders braving all odds and resisting all brutal attacks of the BJP government. Many have laid own their lives. Have they sacrificed lives for postponement of the Laws? They had said, ‘kanun wapsi to gharwapsi’ meaning no going back home till the Laws are repealed. Should we allow their sacrifice to go in vain? Our appeal to this meeting—please do not fall in this trap of the government. Let us take a resolve to continue the struggle till the Laws are annulled.” Responding to our appeal which was the loudly applauded  by many other organizations,  it was decided to continue the movement till the demands were made. And this decision was what exactly the peasants wanted from the core of their heart.</p>

        <p>With a view to scaring the peasants, the criminal brigade of the RSS-BJP attacked them at Singhu border on 29 January 2021. It was pretended that the attackers were residents of adjacent villages and they were furious because of being inconvenienced due to the sit-in demonstration. In fact those who pounced upon the peasants with arms were not local people. They were brought by the BJP from Delhi. AIKKMS had, by that time, formed 47 village committees in the villages adjoining Singhu border. In protest against the attack, the AIKKMS organized a big rally on 30 January 2021 mobilizing peasants from those villages. That rally comprised over 1000 tractors, 700 motorbikes and hundreds of peasants. When that 3 km long procession arrived at Singhu border, the peasants gave them a big ovation.</p>
        
        <p>During the movement, another important question had arisen that the movement should not be confined to Delhi borders but must spread out across the country. All sections of toiling people as well as conscientious intelligentsia should be brought within the ambit of the movement. In this respect also, role of AIKKMS is worth mentioning. AIKKMS workers have worked tirelessly to extend the movement in 21 provinces. They have organized Maha panchayat  in the states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka etc. As many as 15 Kishan panchayats were organized in Rewari district of Haryana alone. Maha panchayets were organized in Sonipat and other districts of Haryana  as well. Thousands of peasants joined these Maha panchayets. In many states, AIKKMS took leading role in spreading the movement. Apart from AIKKMS, fraternal organizations like AIDSO, AIDYO and AIMSS also made remarkable contributions in intensifying the movement.</p>

        <h4>Lessons of this great movement</h4>

        <p>We know that this movement has been radiant with exemplary courage, firm resolve, grit, determination and self-sacrifice. This movement has shown what is people’s power and its creative application. The movement has also given us many other important lessons. These lessons would guide the toiling millions in their future struggles. We know from the teachings of Comrade Shibdas Ghosh that when one fight against oppression and injustice, one’s human essence flourishes. One becomes a new man. This movement has further proved the efficacy of that teaching. What is worth noting is that in this movement, people have cemented their unity rising above caste, creed, religion or ethnicity. To be more precise, this movement has significantly taken forward the process of democratization of North Indian societies. It is of  immense significance.</p>

        <p>The bourgeois rulers create an illusion about judiciary particularly the Supreme Court. They impress upon the people that judiciary is neutral and above all criticisms. This myth about the Supreme Court has been exposed by this movement. It has categorically shown that the Supreme Court nor the judiciary is neutral. In the capitalist system, the judiciary works in the interest of the ruling monopolists and multinationals. So one cannot expect proper justice from it.</p>

        <p>But the most important lesson of this movement has been to identify the real enemy. Hitherto, in all democratic movements, one or the other government was seen as the enemy. The government was viewed as the main enemy. So the wrath and grievances had accumulated against the government. Capitalizing on that, the opposition parties reaped electoral benefit. They have directed the people’s grievances to culminate in ballot box. In absence of correct revolutionary leadership, the mass movements ended in bringing out a change of government. Likewise, all the democratic movements, in the ultimate analysis, have failed to be led to their logical culmination and generate higher consciousness among people. Our Party and its class and mass fronts have been trying utmost to carry the message to the fighting people that the real enemy is not the government but ruling capitalism. The government is a caretaker or gatekeeper of the ruling bourgeoisie. People would have to develop anti-capitalist revolutionary struggle and overthrow capitalism. Only then the much-yearned emancipation of the people would come by. Though this consciousness has dawned upon a section of the people, we have not been able to make the majority of the toiling masses participating in the democratic movements to imbibe this truth. But that our efforts have not been futile is proved by this peasant movement. Thousands of people who have come within the fold of this movement could understand in whose interest the Black Laws had been framed. They could make out that Modi-led BJP government  brought these Laws to serve the interest of the Ambanis-Adanis-Tatas-Birlas and the multinationals. So a slogan has been raised from within the movement that Modi is a façade of the corporates. His job is to work under the dictates of the corporates and in the interest of the corporates. The movement has given call to boycott the products from the corporate houses and release an all-out struggle against them. This is a totally new phenomenon in the history of people’s movement in India. It has never happened in the country that lakhs of people are unitedly raising voice against the corporates and multinationals. There is no doubt that this consciousness has raised the democratic movement of this country to a new height. From the perspective of developing revolutionary movement, this consciousness is of tremendous importance. What is the revolutionary significance of this consciousness? Had any government been the main enemy, then changing that government through election would have resolved all problems. But that is not the case. Main enemy are the Ambanis-Adanis-corporate capital. They cannot be defeated by election. By casting vote, it is not possible to curtail the power and influence of corporate capital like the Ambani-Adani houses. But unless the monopoly corporate capital is defeated, the pressing problems of life would not remedied. So, how to do that? While seeking answer to this question, people would realize that reforms would not do. Capitalism has to be uprooted. So they would search for proper ideology and political leadership which can fulfil this task. In course of that, they would find the correct revolutionary leadership under whose guidance they would develop struggle and create new society, new civilization. This great peasant movement is giving indication of that. This revolutionary consciousness would not be generated overnight. Through many struggles of this kind, we shall be able to evolve that.</p>

        <h4>Tasks ahead</h4>

        <p>It is true that the movement has been victorious. But it is to be borne in mind that monopoly capital, multinationalsand their agents would bring down onslaughts without relent. Already the BJP agriculture minister has threatened that the three Black Farm Laws would be brought back. So, there ought not to be any diffusion of the struggling spirit and fervour. No lax should be allowed in preparedness to face the attacks. The peasant movement should be so prepared that they can consider any attack of the monopoly houses or multinationals on any section of the toiling mases as an assault on them and  jump into movement to resist that.</p>

        <p>True that this great movement was developed by the peasants. But this was not a movement of the peasants alone. All sections of the society spontaneously joined the movement. Students-Youths-women all came forward and stood by the movement. So was raised the slogan from the movement—long live worker-peasant unity. From the very inception of the movement, we had seen how the workers’ organizations came out in support of and solidarity with that. On the other hand, the peasants organizations are now standing by the  movements of the workers’ organizations. Because both have them have understood that their enemy is one and the same—the corporate capital and multinationals. Unless they thwart the attacks of corporate capital, they would all perish. And for that is needed their united struggle. The new consciousness of worker-peasant unity has arisen from this very necessity. This consciousness would further grow and finetuned. On the edifice of this class unity, greater struggles would  surge forth in the days to come. And in course of intensification of these struggles with passage of time, a new society, an exploitation-free socialist society would be founded.</p>

        <p>With is object, we have to struggle hard. Comrade Shibdas Ghosh had founded AIKKMS to shoulder this very responsibility. He said that when thousands of revolutionary workers would come from the families of the workers and peasants, revolution would be accomplished in this country. We shall fulfil that objective. We shall fight and we shall win.</p>
