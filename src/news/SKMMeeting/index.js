    <b>( Fascist BJP government tabled a proposal to SKM that it would withheld the three farm acts for one and half year and requested SKM to withdraw the movement. Receiving this proposal some peasant organisations showed vacillations. But AIKKMS stood firmly and placed the following proposal in the SKM meeting on January 21,2021.The meeting unanimously passed the proposal and rest is history.)</b>

    <p>Dear friends,</p>
    <p>Braving the tremendous cold and the suppression and oppression of the central BJP government the peasants of Punjab along with the peasants of other states are waging struggle with undaunted spirit. BJP government is trying its utmost to crush this movement. Even it  is trying to use the Supreme court cunningly against this movement. Now it has tabled a proposal to withheld the three farm acts for one and half year. But the peasants,who are sitting on the streets are not struggling to withheld the acts for a given period of time. They are fighting to repeal the acts altogether. So our organisation, AIKKMS is appealing to this august House to continue the struggle till the three black farm acts and Electricity Amendment bill -2020 are not repealed. We are placing this proposal for your kind consideration.</p>
