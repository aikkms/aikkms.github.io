Being the custodian of the country, it is but natural that your government must provide proper attention and care to the people of the country, and especially to the vast toiling masses who are deprived of almost all types of medical and health facilities. Apart from farmers, agricultural workers, rural daily wage earners, and a large number of their family members, have to go out of their homes for livelihood, and even as migrant workers to other states, in far-flung corners of the country. Women scheme workers who work as Anganwadi, Asha and mid-day meal workers also come from these rural and urban poor families.</p>\r\n    <p>Even during the first wave of the Covid pandemic, this majority of the country’s population had to  undergo inexplicable sufferings, hardships and deaths both due to the corona infection, as well as as government inaction. Undoubtedly, your government knew that this second wave was coming, but in the face of it, the government system has not been seen taking any anticipatory steps. Indeed, it lagging far behind what needs to be done urgently in terms of protecting the health, lives and livelihoods of the people. The necessary campaign to stop the infection at the community level, to alert the people and to make them aware of the precautionary steps and protocols that are needed to prevent the spread of the disease was not carried out at all properly, On the contrary, in the recently concluded general elections in five states, the ruling parties, both in the Centre and the states, did not show an iota of concern or hesitation in massive election rallies and meetings, giving no consideration of what mega-spreaders of the virus these would be.</p>\r\n    <p>The situation has reached an unprecedented and frightening phase. People are dying from mass infection. Covid  testing, ambulance services, hospitals, beds for patients, oxygen, ventilators, medicines, and physicians, nurses as well other medical staff, all fall far short of what is required at present . Every moment, patients are dying of covid infection, among whom are large number of young people and adults on whom depended the future and entire livelihoods of their families.</p>\r\n    <p>The worst thing is that the government is completely ignoring its responsibilities. The helpless general citizen, a poor householder is being burdened with the responsibility regarding the covid infection. The government’s approach and functioning is not pro-people. Instead of providing all the basic services required for health care and to fight the diseae, the response of the government is to  impose a lockdown. People are being deprived of bus services and rail services which have been available to some extent till now. The migrant workers are again in danger of losing their jobs.  They will be unable to return to their homes. There are no arrangements for transporting milk, vegetables etc. from the villages to the markets.  Apart from all other difficulties people have to face, prices of essential items is spiralling upwards.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>Vaccination is not available everywhere.  Vaccination of the entire population must be done within a fixed time frame.  But the priority has not been given by the government to provide free universal vaccination. The entire vaccination process should be carried out under direct government supervision.</p>\r\n    <p>Vaccine production should be increased immediately.  If necessary, vaccines should also be imported as per requirement. But the government-declared vaccine policy prefers corporate profits over people’s precious lives.  The government has decontrolled vaccine prices by adopting a new vaccine policy shamelessly pandering to the interest of the profit margins of the vaccine and drug manufacturers. Basically, the Central Government’s vaccine policy forces state governments to purchase the much needed vaccines from the open market.</p>\r\n    <p>It is atrocious that the Serum Institute has announced Rs 400 per dose of of its Covishield vaccine, sourced from Astra Zeneca, for state governments and Rs 600 for private hospitals in India. The same vaccine is priced at 1.78 euros (Rs 160) in Europe, $ 4 (Rs 300) in the US and Bangladesh, Rs 237 in Brazil and Rs 226 in the UK.</p>\r\n    \r\n    <p>This pro-corporate policy will further promote hoarding and black marketing. This is already happening in the case of essential drugs like Remedisvir and oxygen.  This corporate-friendly discriminatory vaccine policy should be withdrawn at once and 100 percent purchase of needed vaccines by the states should be purchased using the PM Care Fund.  Immediate measures must be ensured for adequate supply of vaccines. A government adequately empowered by the Disaster Management Act should not turn its back on its responsibility to prioritize the safety of people’s lives over corporate profiteering during this epidemic.</p>\r\n    <p>It is also clear that public sector companies have always been a helping hand to the nation in all critical conditions. Today, steel companies of public sector produce and supply oxygen.  It is the Indian Railways itself that is delivering oxygen to the needy states. But the government is bent on privatization of essential services, including public sector financial institutions. It must be stopped. We demand that immediate measures be taken to strengthen the existing public sector pharmaceuticals and oxygen production units.  New units should be set up in the public sector to ensure universal and comprehensive public health care.</p>\r\n    <p>Since after the first wave of the epidemic, your government has forcibly imposed many anti-worker, anti-farmer laws in the interest of the big capitalists, corporates, despite stiff and sustained opposition from the toiling masses.  Your government believes in arbitrary, rather than modal, meaningful interactions with the working people.</p>\r\n    <p>We therefore demand that the three black farm laws and the Electricity Amendment Bill 2020 be repealed immediately. Also, legal guarantee should be provided for the purchase of all the produce of farmers at one and a half times more than the cost.</p>\r\n    <p>In this hour of severe crisis arising out of the second wave of the Covid pandemic, and the negligence on the part of Central and State Governments, we strongly demand from you:</p>\r\n    \r\n    <ol>\r\n      <li>Increase vaccine production.  Ensure free universal vaccination within a given time frame.  Ensure free and adequate supply of oxygen to meet the urgent demands of the current crisis.</li>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <li>Ensure adequate number of hospitals, hospital beds, oxygen and other medical facilities, free of cost, for patients to help them cope with the covid pandemic.</li>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <li>Withdraw the anti-people and discriminatory, pro-corporate vaccine pricing policy.</li>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <li>Public health care infrastructure should be strengthened.</li>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <li>During lockdown, retrenchment, pay cuts and evacuation of houses should be strictly prohibited.</li>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <li>Three anti-farmer laws and electricity bill along with four anti-worker labour codes should be scrapped.</li>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <li>There should be a complete ban on privatization and disinvestment of public industries and institutions.</li>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <li>Cash subsidy of Rs. {\"7500\"} per month should be provided to all poor farmers, farm workers and other rural poor families.</li>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <li>For the next six months, 10 kg of free cereals and pulses, edible oil should be made available per person per month.</li>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <li>There should be proper arrangement to provide effective treatment to the patients of diseases other than Covid in government hospitals.</li>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <li>Protective measures for all those engaged in epidemic-management work including           health and front-line workers, ASHA and Anganwadi workers and ensuring comprehensive insurance coverage for all of them.</li>\r\n      \r\n    </ol> \r\n\r\n    <p>With best regards, <br/>\r\n    <b>Indian Peasants</b></p>\r\n  </>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default SecondPage\r\n","import React from \"react\"\r\nimport Article from \"../news/Memorandum\"\r\n\r\nimport Layout from \"../components/layout\"\r\nimport Seo from \"../components/seo\"\r\n\r\nconst Page = () => (\r\n  <Layout pageInfo={{ pageName: \"memorandum-to-pm\" }}>\r\n    <Seo title=\"Memorandum to PM\" />\r\n    <Article />\r\n  </Layout>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default Page\r\n"],"names":["SecondPage","React","style","textAlign","color","Page","Layout","pageInfo","pageName","Seo","title","Article"],"sourceRoot":""}
